<h3>Greedy approach</h3>
<p>I meet this problem from hackrank one years before, at that time I did not resolve it. We need to consider two directions for each person and give him some candys. Think each direcion seprerately. Each person, give hime a candys from left, and give him b candys from right. The minnum candys we should give hime is max(a,b). Otherwise, if you try to meet the condictions, some one will be given zero or less candys.</p>

class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int> &ratings) {
        int n = ratings.size();
        if ( n == 0 ) {
            return 0;
        }
        int l[n];
        int r[n];
        memset(l,0,sizeof(l));
        memset(r,0,sizeof(r));
        l[0] = 1;
        r[n-1] = 1;
        for( int i = 1; i < n; i++ ) {
            int j = (n-1)-i;
            if ( ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] ) {
                l[i] = l[i-1]+1;
            } else {
                l[i] = 1;
            }
            if ( ratings[j] > ratings[j+1] ) {
                r[j] = r[j+1]+1;
            } else {
                r[j] = 1;
            }
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for ( int i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {
            sum += max(l[i],r[i]);
        }
        return sum;

<h3>A better way</h3>
<p>The solutions before needs two array, and actually only one is needed. The second time travel the ratings we can get the answer already.
