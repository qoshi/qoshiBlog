<h3>Lucky</h3>
<p>When I get the information FB is hiring someone in China, I send my resume to them.A week latter ,a hr send me a Email and ask me to talk online.After that talk, I knew I was the first one applying for FB this year in China.That talk does not contain too much thing, just arrange my interview and ask for some personal infomations.</p>

<h3>Fist phone interview</h3>
<p>I was asked the following questions.
<ul>
  <li>Introduce yourself.</li>
  <li>Do you use facebook very often?(I just sign in facebook for a week at that time...) I said not much often, and I use renren more often(The interviewer seems do not know rerne...).</li>
  <li>If you join FB, what will you change the facebook?(This is a typical question they always ask.) I said I need to learn much more, after that I may change something. </li>
  <li>So, what will you change renren, if you join the renren's team? I said I will change the UI.</li>
  <li>Coding question. A problem from leetcode, not hard, but I made a little mistake. She figure it out, and I fixed it quickly. After she asked me the complexity of time and spce.</li>
</ul>
After this question, it's my turn to ask her. I ask her two questions.
<ul>
  <li>What is your team?</li>
  <li>What's your job in your team?</li>
</ul>
After that, I make an apologize for that small bug. She said it's ok and it's already a high score. A hour latter, HR send me a email to arrange the second interview.
</p>
<p>After the first interview, something changed in my mind, and I think I was defeated by this finally. I thought I can get the job, and began to YY...So, I finished leetcode in on week and the second interview is coming.</p>

<h3>Second phone interview</h3>
<p>That network seems not good on that day. I waste a lot time to fix the net work. And that guy interview me seems not an American(after I found hime in facebook and he is an American indeed.) and sounds like a A3. I was ask some questions below:
<ul>
  <li>Introduce the technology which you are good at. If you join FB, what do you want to do in FB.(typical question)</li>
  <li>Why you want to join facebook?(typical question)</li>
  <li>Coding test I. Return the index of the max element in a vector, if there are several answer, return them in the same probability. I resolved it quickly using space complexity O(n) and time complexity O(n). He ask me to improve the space complexity. I figure it out quickly.</li>
  <li><a href="http://qoshi.me/leetcode/2014/08/07/decode-ways.html">Coding test II.</a> <strong>This is why I failed. </strong> A problem from leetcode. At first I said it could be resolved by DFS but, he said he do not know what is DFS. After that he ask me to write the code. During writting I change my mind, I told him I will using dynamic programing, and he seems do not understand too....After I write the code. He ask me why I resolved it like this. I was too nervous at that time, and I mess it up. He ask me some details about my solution and I did not know how to explain at that time. He asked me a sample of that problem and I made a wrong explain. He ask me about complexity of time and spce, I gave hime a right answer. He asked me to save the space complexity, I figure it out quickly. At last, he give me another sample and asked me what does look like? I said Fibonacci. He asked me what is the general term of Fibonacci, I said I don't know.</li>
</ul>
After that, it's my turn to ask him questions. I asked him two questions:
<ul>
  <li>The most exciting thing you have done in FB.</li>
  <li>What is your career plan in future time.</li>
</ul>
Half a month latter, I was told I was failed because my English. The HR advice me to improve my English and she will give me one more chance next year.
</p>
<h3>Advices</h3>
<p>
I have some advices to those who want to have a try in FB.
  <ul>
    <li>Read what HR send you carefully, it is a wonderful guide to interview in FB.</li>
    <li>Work hard on coding.</li>
    <li>Try to explain your code in English and make other understand you.</li>
    <li>Prepare the typical questions.</li>
    <li>Treate every interview as challenge and do not think too much.(This is why I did well in Amazon but failed in FB.)</li>
  </ul>
