<p>Sitting in the plane form Shanghai back to Beijing, it's a little bit tired. I think I do not do well in today's miniAC interview. The interview contains a lot things, like object oriented, algorithms, intelligence, and system design. If I can not get the offer, I think it's because I did not finished the object orented question well. Before two interviews, there is a writing test.</p>

<p>There a two kinds of items in morgan. One is application and the other one is boundle.
  <ul>
    <li>Application contains a mark of whether it could run in win7, and contain a path of its installer.</li>
