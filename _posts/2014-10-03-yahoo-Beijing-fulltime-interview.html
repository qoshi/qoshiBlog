<h3>Summarize</h3>
<p>One important thing: do not write the coding problem so quickly, or there may be some brain pazzle. It is really not cool. After all they told me I passed the interview, and I may be offered. This looks the best ending of the suck September. October is coming, and ther are a lot zombies coming. Hurry up, and keep fighting!</p>
